# Jets

This is my first attempt at a true object oriented program.

This program stores data on a "fleet" of jets with specification to the individual jet. The program allows for the addition 
of one or more cutomized jets by the user, and includes fields that list the fastest and longest range aircraft within the
fleet. The fastest and longest range fields will adapt to the users jet as well.

This program is fairly self explanatory. A user menu populates, and the user enters the selections as wanted.

This is a working program for the specifications of the project declared. However, as time permits more variety and funtionality
will be added to it.
